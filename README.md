## Project Overview:
"Alphabet clash / Afra's ABC" is an educational game designed for young children aged 3 and up to learn the alphabet in a fun and interactive way. This project was created as part of my Frontend Development studies at Noroff, with the aim of combining play and learning for toddlers.

## Technologies Used:
* HTML: For structuring the game content.
* CSS: For styling the game.
* Tailwind CSS: For enhanced and streamlined styling.
* JavaScript: For game logic and interactivity.
* ES6: For modern JavaScript features.

## Game Features:
1) Random Letter Display: A random letter appears on the screen.
2) Keyboard Interaction: The child must press the corresponding key
on the keyboard within 30 seconds.
3) Scoring System:
- Correct answers earn a point and trigger a cheerful beep sound.
- Incorrect answers reduce the player's lives, change the screen color to a darker red, and play a 'wrong' sound.
4) Lives System: Players start with 5 lives. The game ends when all lives are lost, encouraging the child to try again.

## How to Play:

-- Open the game [here](https://afras-abc.netlify.app/)
-- A random letter will be displayed on the screen.
-- Press the corresponding key on your keyboard.
-- Earn points for correct answers and lose lives for incorrect answers.
-- The game ends when you run out of lives. Try to score as high as possible!

## Project Inspiration: 
The inspiration for "Alphabet Clash" came from my young daughter, who often showed curiosity about using my laptop. I wanted to create an educational tool that could channel her curiosity into learning the alphabet, making the process enjoyable and interactive.
